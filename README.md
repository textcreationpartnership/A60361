      * Quest. 1. THis seemes a poore Question indeed, what is your Name?

      * 2. Yet it is a small question?

      * 3. Tis a question though, that every child can tell?

      * 4. But it is the least question that can be?

      * 5. It seemes a triviall question?

      * 6. It seemes though too meane a one?

      * 7. But is it not a simple and contemptible one?

      * 8. What question was that?

      * 18. How meane you that?

      * 19. Why should we remember these things?

      * 20. But who can forget these things?

      * 21. Can any forget their names?

      * 22. How meane you that?

      * 23. But were names imposed for any such memoriall of holy things?

      * 24. Is it lawfull then to alter names?

      * 25. How meane you that?

      * 1. VVHo gave you this name?

      * 2. When was it?

      * 3. What benefit thereby?

      * 4. Why doe you call the Sureties Godfathers and Godmothers?

      * 9. How then is it said the Godfathers doe it, or are required to name it?

      * 10. But have not some kept their old names, as those of yeares baptized?

      * 11. How are names then said received in Baptism?

      * 12. But we finde many received names before baptisme.

      * 13. Jt is then most convenient to give names in Baptisme?

      * 14. But divers instances may bee given to the contrary for Circumcision?

      * 15. For Gersom, he was named ere circumcised.

      * 16. All the children of Israel in the wildernesse notcircumcised, yet had names assuredly?

      * 16. Benoni was named by Rachel before circumcision.

      * 17. But Saint John Baptist, and Christ also by the Angels before circumcision.

      * 18. It standeth then with best reason or conveniency to have the name imposed in baptisme.

      * 19. Is that most convenient?

      * 20. But why are children baptized, being infants, and not rather when they come to yeares, and discretion?

      * 21. How in imitation of circumcision?

      * 22. How from the example of Christ?

      * 23. How pertaines the covenant to them?

      * 24. Why also presented so in the Church?

      * 25. Then it is good children should be soon baptised?

      * 26. Is baptisme then a meanes thereof?

      * 27. Then it is faith, and not baptisme that saveth?

      * 28. Both faith and baptisme then are required?

      * 29 How doth this then pertain to Infants?

      * 30. But is this enough?

      * 31. Many then are baptized, that are not saved?

      * 32. Is it then easily to be discerned who shall be saved?

      * 33. Then are we to account all members of Christ that are baptized?

      * 34. What use of Baptisme?

      * 35. What profit in the remembrance thereof?

      * 36. How may that be effected?

      * 53. How are the elect the sons of God?

      * 54. Why are not the falling Angels in like hope?

      * 55. How then should men lesse excellent be saved?

      * 56. How is that?

      * 57. There is then onely that meanes left of mans salvation?

      * 58. This is then a great priviledge?

      * 59. What benefit by this priviledge or prerogative?

      * 60. How is the inheritance of heaven then due to us?

      * 61. Why did the Lawyer then say, Master, what shall I doe to inherit eternall life?

      * 62. The question was not then well proposed.

      * 64. Are they inheritors then onely so?

      * 65. How is it said a kingdome?
